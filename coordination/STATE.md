## Current baseline

Frozen architecture baseline:
- `ML-DEVOS-ARCH-001 / v1.2.0`

Active Sentinel governance-capability baseline:
- `v1.4.0`

S2:
- CLOSED

Legacy archive remediation:
- CLOSED under `ML-DEVOS-AS-009`

## Authority chain

Product-build-pack direction:
- `D-020`

Product-build-pack documentation authorization:
- `D-021`

## Authorized Builder outputs

Claude may create/update only:

- `docs/product/PRD.md`
- `docs/product/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`
- `docs/product/UI_UX_SPEC.md`
- `docs/product/APP_FLOW.md`
- `docs/product/DATA_BACKEND_SPEC.md`
- `docs/product/BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `coordination/IMPLEMENTER_HANDOFF.md`
- `coordination/STATE.md`
- durable documentation/index references strictly needed to link this pack, if they do not change product/runtime behavior

## Required content rules

- consolidate/reference existing repository truth rather than duplicating or silently superseding it;
- keep Sentinel/DevOS governance authoritative for scope, authority, evidence, change control, and review;
- make `APP_FLOW.md` the clearest current product/admin/user flow map;
- make `DATA_BACKEND_SPEC.md` design/specification only, covering future entities, relationships, state, auditability, storage/media boundaries, validation/security constraints, and migration considerations;
- make `BUILD_PLAN.md` dependency-ordered and bounded, with each future implementation increment independently reviewable;
- encode:
  `Product Spec → Architect consistency check → acceptance criteria → dependency-ordered bounded tasks → Claude implementation increment → tests/evidence → Architect independent review → next increment`.

## Explicitly prohibited

- no S3 proposal or implementation
- no website/admin/backend implementation
- no application/runtime code changes
- no D1/R2/API provisioning
- no project onboarding
- no project registry population
- no product `.devos/` overlay
- no CI/workflows
- no GitHub rulesets/branch protection
- no production deployment
- no protected/main merge

## Required Builder completion state

When documentation implementation is complete, Claude must set:

- `TURN: ARCHITECT`
- `STATUS: READY_FOR_ARCHITECT`
- `ARCHITECT_ACTION_REQUIRED: YES`
- `IMPLEMENTER_ACTION_REQUIRED: NO`
- `PAULO_DECISION_REQUIRED: NO`

and stop.

## Architect review rule

Before issuing a verdict, the Architect must:

1. pull the live Sentinel branch/state;
2. inspect the exact Builder handoff commit;
3. compare the exact diff against `D-020` and `D-021`;
4. compare the new product docs against existing website governance, architecture, brand/design, content-schema, and Sentinel records;
5. check for duplication, contradictions, hidden implementation authorization, or unsupported assumptions;
6. only then issue PASS / CHANGES_REQUESTED.
